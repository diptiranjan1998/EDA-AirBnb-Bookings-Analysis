### For this project our team is analyzing Airbnbâ€™s New York City data. New York is not only one of the the most famous city in the world but also top global destination for visitors drawn to its museums, entertainment and commerce (Main attraction is Statue of Liberty). According to the Office of New York State Comptroller, New York hosted 66.6 million visitors in 2019.

### Data analysis on thousands of listings provided through Airbnb is a crucial factor for the company. This dataset has around 49000 observations in it with 16 columns and it is a mix between categorical and numeric values. We will explore and visualize the dataset from Airbnb using basic exploratory data analysis(EDA). 

### Our team has analyzed this dataset using different different logics and aspects. After proper analysis we have come up with some interesting and usefull insights. This can help AirBnb in making strategies and decisions by the help of marketing team, finance team and technical team.
